# UAVs Visual Simulation, A Python Approach

The presented software is a solution to a common problem in machine learning and computer vision applied to UAVS. 

In the early phases of an algorithm, it is necessary to be able to simulate it and observe if its running as intended, making necessary corrections and bug catching before downloading and running it in a real platform, enabling a faster development speed and lowering costs of Implementation.

Simulating cameras with good performance is a particularly difficult task, even more so on python, developing one from scratch would take a lot of time, effort, and a good performance wasn't garanteed, so a python game engine was chosen, called Panda3D. 

With this engine and its integration on the presented software, it is possible to simulate commom UAVs missions, as well as its dynamics, on-board or off-board cameras, object visualisation and colision detection. 


At this moment, the presented software is capable of:

1. Fully functional quadrotor
2. On-board and off-board cameras
3. Direct OpenCv integration. 
4. Fully Customizable Dynamics
5. Fully Customizable Scenario Model
6. Fully Customizable UAV Model

In future versions we plan to include:

1. Object Colision Detection
